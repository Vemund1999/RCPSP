# RCPSP
## About project 
This projects is for two algorithms to solve RCPSP.
The first algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm using priority rules,
and the second algorithm is particle swarm optimization (without priority rules).

The algorithms are described and compared in the report.pdf file.


## How to run
Run the Main file.

## Usage
The usage of the algorithm is shown in the Main file.
